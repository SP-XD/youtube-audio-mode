# Youtube Audio Mode
Listen to just the audio on YouTube without loading the video.
Tested on Chrome, Edge and Firefox.

This does not work well on Google's new layout. 
You can downgrade to the old one here: https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/32906-get-me-old-youtube.
Performance improvments with this script are probably negligible however I haven't tested.

## Setup
1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net)
2. [click here](https://git.io/vhek9) to install the script.

Audio mode can be enabled/disabled in the player's settings.
